##What does that relationship look like though?

Yes, twitter is not representative, but it's the only access some people have to this conversation.

Identifiers are redacted because this isn't about the people, societies, or journals.

###"This is a subtweet: #bropen dudes who critise [sic] everything that is not absolute perfection re #OpenScience make me want to throw things."

###"online vigilantes are attacking individuals... Self-appointed data police... bullies... methodological terrorism... destructo-critics""

###"That weak uninformed defense by @[redacted] was more than I could stand."

###"These authors p-hacked their way into [redacted] and are now sending off press releases like it is 2012. Because I feel really bad for the ECR's on this paper I'm skipping the obligatory [redacted] joke."

###"Why is [redacted] still publishing p-hacked bullshit? p = .05's and =.04's. Nope. Disregard."

###"...here I go: "Bros" is just another word for "tone". The Open Science movement does not have a real problem with either."

--

###These are signals to me of intergroup processes.

???

Terms like "mob rule" and "tone policing" are part of almost every conversation about open practices. 

..and as someone on the individual differences end of the social psych spectrum... I HATE group processes.

###Representations matter for prejudice creation, persistence, and reduction 
####(Ogan et al., 2014; Paluck, 2009) 
 
###Contact may help prejudice
####(Binder et al, 2009; Lemmer and Wagner, 2015)

###Can it work for us?

##It depends.

###Negatively valenced contact makes things worse 
####(Barlow et al., 2012)

???
obvious, but hey, we have data
Not saying the only barrier to openness is social, I'm simply saying we should have the social factors working for it, not against it.

###People are likely to adopt behaviours if they identify with those who already engage.

###If the available models are not like them, that impedes adoption.

???
Models like Prototype Willingness Model suggest models are important.
Current approaches decrease likelihood of engagement because of the stigmatised identity.

## SUMMARY: We need to get off twitter and have people meeting in the world.

###Do you feel comfortable advocating for all aspects of open practice? 

--

###How many of you can speak to the challenges of other disciplines? 

--

###Do you even know open researchers outside of your group/lab? Your discipline? 


???
Coordination is needed, to make it easier to be present in the research culture, and to be more diverse and positive. A la Open Science Community Utrecht (https://twitter.com/verbeeldingskr8/status/1057179562470240256)

If you're in Melbourne and want to help change this dialogue, to be a part of a positive conversation that's about sharing practices and promoting growth, fill in our survey, join our mailing list, follow our social media and get in touch.
If you're not from Melbourne and think this is a model you want to adopt, come speak to me and I'll share what I know/have.
Together we can make "open research practices" into "research Practices", and all research credible and reproducible.
